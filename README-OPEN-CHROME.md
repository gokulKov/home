How to open the hosted site in Google Chrome

Two helper scripts are included to open https://gokulkov.github.io/home/ explicitly in Chrome on Windows.

Usage:

- Batch file (double-click):
  scripts\open-in-chrome.bat

- PowerShell (right-click -> Run with PowerShell or run from terminal):
  scripts\open-in-chrome.ps1

Notes:
- If Chrome isn't installed in the usual Program Files locations, the scripts will fall back to opening the URL in the default browser.
- You can create a Desktop shortcut that points to the batch file for one-click access.
